Problem 1: The company does not fully understand why customers leave. Churn may be influenced by contract type, service quality, missing features, or high monthly charges.

Problem 2: The business cannot easily identify which customer groups are most at risk and require retention efforts.

Problem 3: It is unclear which combinations of services contribute to customer loyalty and which do not.

Problem 4: Some customers have inconsistent billing values (e.g., high tenure but very low TotalCharges), suggesting errors or payment issues that may cause dissatisfaction and churn.
